# Wirepair RLC

This folder contains the simulation code for the wirepair RLC 3D simulation. 
To run the simulation, open `wirepair.pro` in Gmsh and press the Run button.

The 2D simulation code is in the "2D" subfolder, while the IABC subfolder contains a 3D model using a 4th order Improvised Asymptotic Boundary Condition for the exterior region instead of the shell transformation.

Requirements: [ONELAB](https://onelab.info/) software (Gmsh and GetDP).
